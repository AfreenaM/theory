1.what is view and why it is use in django?

ans:>>In the model view controller (MVC) architecture, the view component deals with how data is presented to users for consumption and viewing. In the Django framework, views are Python functions or classes that receive a web request and return a web response. 
>>The response can be a simple HTTP response, an HTML template response, or an HTTP redirect response that redirects a user to another page. Views hold the logic that is required to return information as a response in whatever form to the user. As a matter of best practice, the logic that deals with views is held in the views.py file in a Django app.

2.what is rest API?

ans:>>A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

>>An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user—establishing the content required from the consumer (the call) and the content required by the producer (the response). For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low.  

>>In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and fulfill the request.
